
Key Characteristics of Expressions:
Always Returns a Value: Every expression in Python results in some value, whether itâ€™s a number, a string, or a Boolean (True or False).
Can Be Simple or Complex
Used in Statements: Expressions are often part of statements (but not all statements are expressions).
